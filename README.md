# 🧠 GazeCraze - Real-Time Concentration Detection Using Face Landmarks

**GazeCraze** is a modular Python application that uses computer vision and facial landmark detection to analyze user concentration in real-time. It leverages MediaPipe Face Mesh, OpenCV, and head/eye tracking techniques to infer gaze alignment and focus level from webcam video streams.

## 📊 Notebooks

Explore the logic and debugging tools via Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory:

- [`face_mesh.ipynb`](notebooks/face_mesh.ipynb) – Debug and understand MediaPipe's face mesh outputs.
- [`eye_indexes.ipynb`](notebooks/eye_indexes.ipynb) – Visualize eye region indices and landmark positions.

These notebooks help visualize facial landmarks and debug model behavior effectively.
